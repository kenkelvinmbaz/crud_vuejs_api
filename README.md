I just created a API based on php back-end and Vue.js for the Front-end. That allow you to Read, Create,Update and Delete datas.

-use the db.php to connect you database, setting at connection doc
- all the api is setting in the model.php inside the api doc
- pass all data from your form inside the index.js
